The assembly language seemed a little confusing to me at first, being so different from other languages I have seen. It took me some time to understand where to write the text I wanted to display and how the whole thing ran. I struggled to remember the call numbers for the system calls and what the registers actually did. I struggled with assembling and running the code via terminal commands, such as nasm and ld. In the end, my code ran fine; figuring out all the steps and where each step went took me some effort.
